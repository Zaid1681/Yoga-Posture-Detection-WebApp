# Yoga Pose Detection & Correction System

The Yoga Posture Detection System is a computer vision-based tool that can automatically identify and monitor the positions of the human body when practising yoga.This system accurately detects and categorises yoga postures in real-time, giving practitioners immediate feedback. It is based on Mediapipe library of ML and Deep Learning. The images are skeletonized before inputting into the model. The skeletonization process is done using the MediaPipe library for body keypoint detection . Its main aim is to record and evaluate several characteristics of the body posture, such as joint angles, body alignment, and movement patterns by the system which includes cameras. Using this approach, which may be utilised for private yoga practise, one can completely alter how yoga is taught and done. The Yoga Posture Detection System can help practitioners improve their posture, avoid injuries, and increase the overall effectiveness of their yoga practice by offering real-time feedback and instruction.

The angles listed below are accurate ones, and we taught our system to recognise these kinds of photographs.

The following image demonstrates the precision of the warrior pose as well as the adjustments we must do to improve it.

All these postures are included in this project
